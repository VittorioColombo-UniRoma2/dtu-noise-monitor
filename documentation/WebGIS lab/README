In this folder you find support on setting up a basic but working mapping environment 
based on Windows, running MapServer mapping engine, with Apache at the frontend and PostgreSQL/PostGIS at the backend.

Please read instruction file "Web GIS lab.docs": this file will drive you through the entire setup process.
Provided you have (any) working Windows ennvironment available (virtual machines welcome),
you will first install the database, then the MS4W package that includes MapServer and Apache already configured.

The environment comes with OpenLayers already embedded and functional, you may want to experiment with Leaflet instead
(sample file are provided) see "TO DO.docs" file.
